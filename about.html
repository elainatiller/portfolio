                    I am passionate about understanding how and why technology works. My future career goals lie in product managment.
                    I currently work for two organizations where I work as a project/product manager. For VOID TEC consulting, I am working
                    on developing an organized ecommerce site for a local book shop with a large inventory. In other club, REACH I am conducting 
                    user research and data analysis for a software company to evaluate the architecture of the website.
