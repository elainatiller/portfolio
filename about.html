                <p class="about-me">
                    I thought computer science was the only way to ensure a lifetime career in building technology. 
                    I was captivated by the goal-oriented nature of coding and debugging, and learning how the technology 
                    I took for granted worked behind the scenes. However, I was wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    I am passionate about understanding how and why technology works. My future career goals lie in product managment.
                    <br>
                    My fascination with the full development of products led to my current role as a product manager for Void Tec. consulting club.
                    I am gaining valuable experience working cross-functional with the client, the design team, and the development team to create an e-commerce
                     book site. This role is challenging my communication and research skills where I am timelining the development of putting my client's 10 
                     thousand book inventory on the website to maxamize her profits. I analyzed and empathized with the websiteâ€™s users to prioritize a contactless
                     seamless pickup feature. My team implemented a form on the homepage with email confirmation to avoid users spending time clicking through the website 
                     or contacting the owner through different avenues. As my team iteratively develops the website, I prioritize the features that provide access to older 
                     customers and focus on reducing the client's inventory and hosting costs. Additionally, our team used WooCommerce which challenged my research skills
                     and I even wrote a script converting the inventory file to an ftp format for square space. 
                    <br><br>
                    In other club, REACH I am conducting user research and data analysis for TechSmith, a software company, to evaluate the architecture of the website.
                    The goal is to give a redesign of the navigation bar and show existing customers to their plethera of support.
